# My idea on the Mark Andreessen's view to Software

This article was quite intriguing, in a sense that this idea really supports my startup idea. This says the software is eating the world, even including those really old industries. I will also work on to create a software, AI service for such industry, and this article encourages me because sometimes I feel transforming such industries in tech seems impossible but yet it's actually possible. Furthermore, it also made me realize the emergence of Web3 and AI even accelerates this trend of "software is eating the world".
